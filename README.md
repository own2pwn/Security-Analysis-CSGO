# Security-Analysis-CSGO
A repository containing standard/common methods used to manipulate memory in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
For educational purposes only.

This repository contains the source code for two methods commonly used to exploit Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

External
--------
The external folder contains undetected methods for acquiring a handle to the game client.
It contains common structs for players, entities, and glow objects, as well as functions that manipulate memory to achieve well known cheats such as: aimbot, wallhack, and triggerbot.

Internal
--------
The internal folder contains undetected methods for accessing and modifying game data.
Unlike the external method, the internal hacking method is done via a .dll that is injected into the process. Once a part of the process, internal cheats can access and modify game data directly.


Both folders contain similar implementations for the most famous types of exploits.
